Symmetry-Adapted Learning of Three-dimensional Electron Density Responses
========================================================================
This repository contains an implementation of sparse Gaussian Process Regression that is suitable to do machine learning of electronic density responses, as described in A. Lewis, P. Lazzaroni, M. Rossi, J. Chem. Phys. 159, 014103 (2023).

This method was developed on the basis of  an older version of the SALTED method, that is hosted in https://github.com/andreagrisafi/SALTED

This code used to be a branch in that repository, however, the codes have since diverged and soon (2024) will be replaced by a different approach for vector-field prediction. We keep this repository
for the purpose of reproducibility of past and future published results.
